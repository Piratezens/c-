Here are well-written prompts for each question from your **"LAB 5: Inheritance and Polymorphism"** document. These prompts are ready for use with ChatGPT, online compilers, or teaching materials.

---

### 1. Prompt for Question 1:

> **Write a C++ program to demonstrate inheritance by implementing the following:**
>
> * Create a base class `Cricketer` with member variables: `name`, `age`, and `matchesPlayed`.
> * Derive two classes from it:
>
>   * `Bowler` (with additional member: `wickets`)
>   * `Batsman` (with additional members: `runs`, `centuries`)
> * Include appropriate member functions in all classes to input and display data.
> * Demonstrate usage by creating objects for both `Bowler` and `Batsman`.

---

### 2. Prompt for Question 2:

> **Write a C++ program to illustrate the concept of function overriding.**
>
> * Create a base class with a virtual function.
> * Create a derived class that overrides this function.
> * Use base class pointers to call the function and observe the output.
> * Clearly show how function overriding works using virtual functions and dynamic dispatch.

### 3. Prompt for Question 3:

> **Write a C++ program to implement inheritance as shown in the given diagram.**
>
> (If a specific diagram is meant here, include it or describe the formâ€”single, hierarchical, multilevel, multiple, etc.)
>
> * Define the classes based on the provided inheritance structure.
> * Use meaningful member functions to read and display data from each class.
> * Create instances and demonstrate how data flows through the inheritance chain.

---

### 4. Prompt for Question 4:

> **Write a C++ program to illustrate the execution order of constructors and destructors:**
>
> * When both the base and derived classes have their own constructors and destructors.
> * Implement for:
>
>   * **Single inheritance**
>   * **Multiple inheritance**
> * Use print statements in each constructor and destructor to show the execution sequence.
> * Demonstrate the order by creating and destroying objects.
